# Deployment-Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
Project description:

1. Built classification model using dataset of residents of cities to predict whether patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

2. Developed binary classification using ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, XGboost,Random Forest and SVM with the radial kernel and carried out hyperparameter tuning using GridsearchCV.

3. Performed missing value imputation , implemented SMOTE boosting on normalized data to handle class imbalance and used Tree based: Select From Model (RF) for feature selection and selected the important features.

4. SVM with F1 score 92% and AUC score 98% was selected best performing model after evaluating the performance of all models which made sure that people with risk are not missed out & people with no risk are not panicked by wrong prediction.
